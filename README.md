# Cog

## Description

This project was created as a demonstration of what could be created to assist those afflicted with Alzheimer's. Submitted as a part of Johns Hopkins' 2023 MESA competition, our group was responsible for designing a mobile application that could assist individuals impacted by a specific health condition. After discussion and a decision matrix, our group chose Alzheimer's.


## Installation
